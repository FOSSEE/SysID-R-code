Description: The package provides functions for constructing mathematical models of dynamic systems from measured input-output data. It lets you create and use models of dynamic systems not easily modeled from first principles or specifications. You can use time-domain and frequency-domain input-output data to identify discrete-time input-output models, transfer functions and state space models.
