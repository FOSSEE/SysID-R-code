# sysid - System Identification in R

The package provides functions for constructing mathematical models of dynamic systems from measured input-output data. It lets you create and use models of dynamic systems not easily modeled from first principles or specifications. You can use time-domain and frequency-domain input-output data to identify discrete-time input-output models, transfer functions and state space models.

## Installation

You can install `sysid` from github using the `devtools` package.

```coffee
require(devtools)
install_github("surajy123/R-sysid/")
```
> Note: Windows users need to install the `Rtools` package.
